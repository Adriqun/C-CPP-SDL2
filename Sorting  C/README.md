##Introduction
Console application based on **eleven** sorting algorithms :books:.                                                           
I wrote it in C-language to keep the speed.  

##How it works
You have to write **one** number between 1-45 000 000, don't worry about mistake programm care about exceptions. If you wrote a
number you will see the time of each sorting algorithms.
