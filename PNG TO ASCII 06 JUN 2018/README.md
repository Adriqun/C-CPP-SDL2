## Introduction
The best idea to see PNG to ASCII converter in action is to set font that has the same width and height in your text editor. PNG to ASCII converter based on lodepng which is PNG image decoder and encoder, read more [here](http://lodev.org/lodepng/). The application is full responsive and gives (without own setup) max 300 chars in a row and column (the 300 chars is current limit).<br/>

## Setup
To have own limit of chars in a row and in a column you have to run exe like: PNG_TO_ASCII "full_path_to_png" "your_limit".<br/>
