Hello everyone!

Ok first, game have a lot of bugs( made in one week )!
I used C, C++ and SDL2 library.

If you want to play just go to the folder bin and find file exe.

If you want to edit code it's no problem but  I want to say it's not my textures and music otherwise chunks.

**
IF YOU WANT TO RUN WITH MAP EDITOR, CHANGE core->setFrame( -2 ) in if( core->getFrame == -1 )
Map editor is easy, key "A" if you want to back 1024 pixels, key "D" if you want to go next 1024 pixels,
key "W" it's mean type( of actual block holding by your cursor ) type ++, and key "S" type--
You can add blocks in notebook but it is uncomfortable, if you want to delete last block just open notebook and delete
last position.
**

I tried to find authors of textures, but I shared that things a long time ago.

Don't make money on someone else's work!
I wanted to present my skill, yea I'm week! :D

If you want to send message, write here -> adrmic98@gmail.com
I will definitely write back. :)
