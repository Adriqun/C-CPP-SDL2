# | binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand
# ^ binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both
# << binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand
# >> binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand
