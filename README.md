#Try Assembly on Linux

###Install nasm
We need **nasm** to create object file by assembly code. <br/>
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netwide_Assembler "Click me!") says: **nasm** is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. It can be used to write 16-bit, 32-bit (IA-32) and 64-bit (x86-64) programs. NASM is considered to be one of the most popular assemblers for Linux. <br/> <br/>

Run <br/>
```
sudo apt install nasm
```
<br/>
