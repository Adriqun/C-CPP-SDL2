Ok first of all the things that you see below it's not my first project, I had a few before but I have never finish them, so I want to show you my first **finished mini project**

>**"Ninja"**

**Following changes:**

It's only one texture, rendering with 60 **F**rames **P**er **S**econd, I try to have clean code, so first I made a simple engine whose contain window, renderer, width and height of window and event(like clicking the mouse)

Adding the hero is trivial, you care about position, control and for example uploading between your hero and enemy.

Let's make some weather! Download a few images of cloud from **google** image, make a drop in **gimp**, random what you can: velocity of cloud, gravitation for drop(also velocity), size of drop, a start position for drop, a diffrent gravitation for each drop, alpha for drops, alpha for clouds etc. **It depend of your imagination!**

When you are coding you will have a moment that you need to do editor map, **it will accelerate your creating so much**, really...

Now you see a collision detection, character is standing on the platform. It's not easy for beginner It might be difficult when you have many objects. I will describe you my first-hand problems later.

When you are far, consistently you have bigger chance to have bugs.

I think now looks better, you see a **hearts** and now I can **pause** the game (top left corner), otherwise I changed color of drop, **white looks like snow?**

Vector for monsters it's good idea, you can easily create new and delete old.
