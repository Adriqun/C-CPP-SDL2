Menu takes a lot of time because you need to set all buttons, it's not a ready made something that you can click and set, you need to launch your application 100 times before final version.<br />
Ok Below you see my 3hour's work of setting the buttons, each works.<br />
To exit topical window for example menu to leave you have to click [escape] or [space]. <br />
**Full menu**<br />

I add alpha functions. Now every texture created by class Texture have function called fade( val = 1 ), you can fadeOut by fade() with negative number and fadeIn with positive. I'm not sure about my English when I want to describe deep affairs, but I hope that you know what I mean. <br/>
The thing that you see below is a menu with changed light.<br/>

That's why: ![alpha](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19840443/17968017/bb6f0f30-6aca-11e6-81ad-77fa0964ee2d.png) <br/>
Texture of light is brighter than title, when I changed the velocity of showing alpha that result was worse. <br/>
